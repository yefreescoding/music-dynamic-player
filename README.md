# Music Player 2.0

A music player with some sick animations and transformations.

## Things to say:

- I created this component to practice with React's useState and useEffect hooks, and learning these technologies would be fun.
- I (eventually) am going to write in this README all the things I did in my development and "creative" process to create this component.
- Very, very, very, and I can't stress this enough, inspired by Apple's design rules, Rauno, Maria, Paco, Vercel. I will link all their social accounts in the full description of the project.
